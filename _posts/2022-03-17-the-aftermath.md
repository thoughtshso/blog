**trigger warnings:** heavy themes of mental health, sexual assault, and suicidal ideation
*this post may also contain much stronger words than I am typically comfortable using to avoid ambiguity*

### fall 2022
A week after ending things with him, I flew back to the Bay Area and moved into Berkeley. I had decided to move into a ministry house with sisters that I didn't know too well. The day I first moved into this ministry house, he showed up to the door unannounced with a couple other friends while I was home alone. **Immediately, "home" became a place that was not safe for me and I got an implicit message that this would not be my place, this would not be my people.** Seeing him triggered me to have a panic attack.

As school started, although he had already graduated the semester before, he continued to show up on campus multiple times a week for large chunks of the day. I would run into him at campus fellowship events, at the student center on-campus, at cafes off-campus, and even randomly on the streets at Berkeley. **I quickly developed a fear of going outside because I was terrified that I would run into him.** I would stay at home unless there was a ministry event that I had to be at, and even when I was in my room, I was continuously worried that he would show up at our ministry house.

The sisters I was living with noticed this, and they showed me so much love by doing what they could to make the house a safe place for me. They told him that he was not welcome at our house, and to please not come by.

That semester, I started serving in the ministry where everybody already knew him, and ran away from processing anything that happened with him because I felt that they would all be on his side. I didn't have any close friends in the ministry, and even the sisters that I was living with who knew what happened had actually just heard what he shared about it.

However, God began to convict me to about unforgiveness in my heart. I didn't fully understand what God was trying to say, because I had swept everything under the rug and had refused to acknowledge all the hurt, but ultimately I came to see that God wanted me to face what had happened.
