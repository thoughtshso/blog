Last night at homegroup we read over Romans 8:1-15 as a group, which reminded
me of the first time I met JL back in Feb 2020. We met at another Bible study
where we read Romans 8 and she spoke so much truth into me that day. Back the
, I had written about what she told me so that I wouldn’t forget what God had
spoken to me through her. Then today, I had my first coffee chat with LK
where she mentioned that she kept a blog, reminding me of my own blog and its
posts. Immediately after that I joined a conversation about phone background
. My phone background is my back profile that was taken at a park in the
middle of the night, where I’m snuggled in my Mexico missions 2019 blanket
staring at the night sky. The reason I had chosen this photo as my background
aside from being aesthetically pleasing—was because of the meaning behind it.
I took this photo to match the essay I wrote for the Presidential Scholars
Application back in February 2020. The essay described my salvation testimony
and how I came to terms with my brokenness. It showed that I do not need to
maintain the pretense of being fine through the imagery of a girl that lives
in the dark and begins accepting that she no longer needs to pretend her moon
is the Sun. This photo was taken on a new moon, when the moon is not visible
but the stars are still vibrant in the sky.

Several hours of linear algebra later, I felt drained and decided to start
worshipping. It was then that God turned my gaze to something else in my room
a pastel drawing that a brother-in-Christ had gifted me nearly a year ago, in
November 2019. The image depicted the back profile of a girl resting on a
swing hanging from the moon, taking rest in the darkness of the night, an
exact rendition of the photo that I had submitted for the Presidential
Scholars App. This drawing had been hanging on my bedroom wall for nearly a
year now, and the photo has been my phone screen background for about half of
that. However, it wasn’t until God pointed it out to me that I realized the
striking similarity between the two. One by one, things came together and I
ve been realizing more how thoroughly God has orchestrated every moment of my
life.

```
“And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.” Romans 8:28
```

I often find myself doubting this fact, but God reminded me again that he
works *all things* together for my good. Overwhelmed by this realization, I
continued to worship God for His goodness and steadfastness.

Now I’ve been reading a book of poems written by a follower of Christ, and
one of the pieces had really struck me.

```
God, I swear I’ll never be as cold as I was before you came,

and God, I swear I’ll never forget the day my life was caught by those two words.

“Follow me” wasn’t a plea, it was a cure to a disease.
```

I’ve been mulling over these three lines for a week, astounded by its
accuracy every time I read it. It told my story so well, because I was a col
, emotionless shell before I met Jesus. I accepted Jesus as Lord over my life
at a retreat titled “Follow Me.” He saved me from my hopelessness and
destitution. This poem also told my salvation testimony in yet another way.
How could a complete stranger write my story with such detail?

As I kept worshipping today, I was led to sing *O Your Love* by Joyce Jo, a
song that’s been stuck in my head for a long time. Right from the first vers
, I was struck by God’s faithfulness yet once again.

```
Here in the stillness of my soul, I see your faithful love, a love that Is enduring through the night

Your gentle spirit comes and warms the cold of my winter years, and promises are rising dawn of spring
```

Wow. As I worship him, he shows me his steadfastness. Through the night, and
through the cold. And he assures me of a coming spring.
