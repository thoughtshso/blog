#### Prologue: The Quest for a Cure
"What must be done to lift the shroud of shame and contempt? The answer involves a strategy that seems to intensify the problem: *peer deeply into the wounded heart.*" (xvi, 1)

"It is unpleasant to face the consequences of sin---our own and others'. To do so seems to discount the finished and sufficient work of our Savior." (xvi, 3)

"A central question in the mind of the abused person---"Where was God?"---compels many to answer by denying the influence of past events on present-day functioning. If the past is insignificant, then I don't need to ponder the question, "Why did God not intervene?" The unbelieving world is willing to see the damage of abuse because it feels no need to defend the God who could have intervened to stop it." (xvii, 5)

""Where was God?" is a legitimate cry of the soul to understand what it means to trust God. Irrespective of the answers, the question is not to be avoided. If God is trustworthy, He can be trusted without our efforts to distort and deny the past." (xviii, 2)

"Let us as Christians acknowledge without shame that regeneration does not alleviate, or in fact diminish, the effects of sin quickly or permanently in this life." (xviii, 4)

"It is labor eminently worthy of every believer to reclaim the parts of one's soul that remain untilled and unproductive for bearing fruit." (xviii, 4)

"It appeared to be acceptable to use the court system for a damaged car, but not for a damaged soul." (xix, 2)

"Under this version of Christianity, the abused person feels secure and dead. There is safety in soul-numbing rigidity that does not require thought, reflection, or risk." (xix, 5)

"The argument of this book is that *the best path is through the valley of the shadow of death*. The crags of doubt and the valleys of despair offer a proving ground of God that no other terrain can provide." (xxii, 2)

"The journey involves bringing our wounded heart before God, a heart that is full of rage, overwhelmed with doubt, bloodied but unbroken, rebellious, stained, and lonely. It does not seem possible that anyone can handle, let alone embrace, our wounded and sinful heart. But the path involves the risk of putting into words the condition of our inner being and placing those words before God for His response." (xxii, 3)

"But promises have been made before by a supposedly trustworthy person, and we swore the betrayal was the last we would ever allow our soul to experience." (xxii, 3)

"*The obstacle to life is the conviction that our God will damage us and destroy us.* The problem is that the path does involve His hurting us but only in order to heal us." (xxii, 3)

"What is the enemy to the healing process? In brief, the answer is shame and contempt." (xxii, 4)

"The stories of my friends cry out for healing, for justice, for the day when all tears will be wiped away and all wrongs avenged." (xxiii, 3)

## Part One: The Dynamics of Abuse
#### [Chapter 1] The Reality of a War: Facing the Battle
"The process of entering the past will disrupt life---or, at least, the existence that masquerades as life. The ease of quiet denial that allows the person to be a pleasant but vacuous doormat or an articulate but driven Bible study leader will be replaced by tumult, fear, confusion, anger, and change." (4, 4)

"What is the point in pursuing firm hope and lively joy? The answer is simple: to live out the gospel. The reason for entering the struggle is *a desire for more, a taste of what life and love could be if freed from the dark memories and deep shame*." (5, 3)

"*To honor what God has called us to be is the reason a man or woman chooses the path of change*." (6, 2)

"*There is a deep reluctance to begin the process of change by admitting that damage has occured.*" (7, 2)

"the potential for minimization or feeling weird for being damaged makes the potential for change even more difficult for those more subtly abused than for those more severely abused." (10, 3)

"Betrayal by an intimate, deeply trusted companion is almost too much for the soul to endure. The victim does not want to face that the perpetrator may have been a person with access to the deepest recesses of his or her soul, a bearer of a key that no one else possessed." (13, 3)

"The fearful and fallen heart does not want to anguish over the loss of safety and nurturance; therefore, the damage is seemingly diminished in the relief that the perpetrator was not someone closer or that the damage could have been more severe." (13, 3)

"All excuses should be silenced; the perpetrator committed a crime against the abused person's body and soul." (14, 2)

"But in every case of abuse, the dignity and beauty of the soul have been violated." (14, 3)

"damage will be *in direct proportion to the degree that it disrupts the protection and nurturance of the parental bond*." (14, 4)

"When abuse is perpetrated, it sets into motion the tremors of an internal earthquake that requires a strong and nurturant environment to quell." (14, 4)

"*The victim's struggle to trust will be proportionately related to the extent her parent(s) failed to protect and nurture her as a child*." (15, 2)

#### [Chapter 2] Facing the Enemy: Shame, Brokenness, and Sanctification
"*The enemy, or so it feels, is the passion to be logvingly pursued and nourishingly touched by a person whose heart is utterly disposed to do us good.*" (19, 2)

"The enemy is *sin*, that fallen, autonomous striving for life that refuses to bow to God. *The enemy is the internal reality that will not cry out to God in humble, broken dependence*." (19, 4)

"The enemy is *[...]* a determined, reliable inclination to pursue false gods, to find life apart from dynamic, moment-by-moment relationship with the Lord of life." (19, 5)

"To understand the depth and extent of sin is the comprehend that our motives, as fallen but regernate beings, are stained by sin, even as we attempt to honorably love God and others. The glory of the Cross is that in spite of every act, thought, or feeling being stained by the Fall, our regenerate deeds are cleansed under the righteousness of our Elder Brother's sacrifice." (22, 1)

"Shame: the dread of being known" (22, 3)

"Unlike other feelings that relinquish some of their power by putting words to the inner sensation, shame has the propensity to increase in intensity when it is first acknowledged." (23, 2)

"*Legitimate shame exposes depravity, and illegitimate shame shines a light on some element of dignity*." (27, 1)

"Her dignity was assaulted, and the horror of the abuse was intertwined with the hunger for an advocate who would tenderly wash her wounds and comfort her." (28, 4)

"Longings and shame were wed to her sense of being a woman whose only worth was being used for someone else's pleasure." (28, 5)

"A godly response in the face of abuse is to grieve---for the perpetrator's sin and for the damage done to our soul; but the natural response is to cower in shame, condemning our own soul for being so foolish as to hope, want, or risk." (29, 1)

"It is the terror that if our dark soul is discovered, we will never be enjoyed, nor desired, nor pursued by anyone." (31, 5)

"Trust is a giving of our soul to another with the hope that we will not be harmfully used. Such trust invests in another the power to determine whether or not we are acceptable and desirable. When trust, defined as *an empowering of another to determine our desirability and worth*, is absent, shame is usually not experienced, even with exposure of our dignity or depravity." (32, 3)

"Shame is experienced before the one I've entitled or given the right to judge me. *[...]* To give that privilege *[...]* to anyone other than God is idolatry." (32, 4)
