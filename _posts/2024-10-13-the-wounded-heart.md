#### Prologue: The Quest for a Cure
"What must be done to lift the shroud of shame and contempt? The answer involves a strategy that seems to intensify the problem: *peer deeply into the wounded heart.*" (xvi, 1)

"It is unpleasant to face the consequences of sin---our own and others'. To do so seems to discount the finished and sufficient work of our Savior." (xvi, 3)

"A central question in the mind of the abused person---"Where was God?"---compels many to answer by denying the influence of past events on present-day functioning. If the past is insignificant, then I don't need to ponder the question, "Why did God not intervene?" The unbelieving world is willing to see the damage of abuse because it feels no need to defend the God who could have intervened to stop it." (xvii, 5)

""Where was God?" is a legitimate cry of the soul to understand what it means to trust God. Irrespective of the answers, the question is not to be avoided. If God is trustworthy, He can be trusted without our efforts to distort and deny the past." (xviii, 2)

"Let us as Christians acknowledge without shame that regeneration does not alleviate, or in fact diminish, the effects of sin quickly or permanently in this life." (xviii, 4)

"It is labor eminently worthy of every believer to reclaim the parts of one's soul that remain untilled and unproductive for bearing fruit." (xviii, 4)

"It appeared to be acceptable to use the court system for a damaged car, but not for a damaged soul." (xix, 2)

"Under this version of Christianity, the abused person feels secure and dead. There is safety in soul-numbing rigidity that does not require thought, reflection, or risk." (xix, 5)

"The argument of this book is that *the best path is through the valley of the shadow of death*. The crags of doubt and the valleys of despair offer a proving ground of God that no other terrain can provide." (xxii, 2)

"The journey involves bringing our wounded heart before God, a heart that is full of rage, overwhelmed with doubt, bloodied but unbroken, rebellious, stained, and lonely. It does not seem possible that anyone can handle, let alone embrace, our wounded and sinful heart. But the path involves the risk of putting into words the condition of our inner being and placing those words before God for His response." (xxii, 3)

"But promises have been made before by a supposedly trustworthy person, and we swore the betrayal was the last we would ever allow our soul to experience." (xxii, 3)

"*The obstacle to life is the conviction that our God will damage us and destroy us.* The problem is that the path does involve His hurting us but only in order to heal us." (xxii, 3)

"What is the enemy to the healing process? In brief, the answer is shame and contempt." (xxii, 4)

"The stories of my friends cry out for healing, for justice, for the day when all tears will be wiped away and all wrongs avenged." (xxiii, 3)
