In the **summer of 2019**, half a year after I started following God, I went on a youth summer mission trip to Mexico. It was a very spiritually active mission field, and although I was almost painfully aware of the spiritual warfare present, I loved it--I felt alive. However, as my closest brothers and sisters were talking about feeling called into ministry, I felt a deep conviction that full-time vocational ministry was not where I was meant to be. And this was not something that I could explain any more than one could explain why they felt a conviction to go into ministry.

As I graduated high school, entered college, and started internships, the calling into the workforce was a constant thought in the back of my mind, but I didn't understand what it meant. In the **summer of 2022**, I was introduced to the corporate office setting and interacted with the same group of people each day as I went into work. As I got familiar with my coworkers and made friends at work, I started questioning: What do workplace relationships look like? What does it mean to be Christian in this setting?

Near end of my internship, I received a last-minute invite from a school alum that I've never met before to attend a brunch event hosted by Faith and Work Movement. As a spur-of-the-moment decision, I showed up to the event (late) without RSVP'ing. A brother shared his testimony of how God had been so faithful to guide his career each step of the way, from the beginning until now, and some praise reports of how he had been able to share his faith with his coworkers, sometimes even praying for them either in-person or over a meeting call.

I heard this testimony and knew immediately that this was what God wanted for my life. **To exemplify the character of Jesus Christ and to share His love and good news to my coworkers unapologetically.** I carried this conviction back to school after my internship ended and continued to explore the calling into the marketplace. Initially, I tried to graduate immediately to go "fulfill" my calling, but realized very quickly through prayer that God actually wanted me to stay in school for a while longer.

Almost a full year after I had planned to graduate, I finally received the call into the workforce through a job offer. It wasn't my first choice team and it required me to drop out of the program I was in, but I comfortably placed these things in God's hands and stepped into the workplace full-time on November 27, 2023.

### H1'2024: culture, character, and compassion

* I could be the only Christian that my coworkers regularly interact with
* It's very possible that the people on my team have never heard the Gospel before
* We have such different background (having immigrated much earlier than them and from a different country)
* Wrestling with the feeling unfavored and unimportant because my closest friends were being called into ministry but I wasn't 
* These are the neighbors that I'm called to love
* I need to reflect the character of Christ at work, which is challenging with 40~50 hour work weeks
* Being called to work dilligently for the Lord, that others may look upon me favorably and also have a positive impression of Christians
* Learning how to view my coworkers as individuals beyond just our technical work interactions; seeing who they are as people and what their lives may look like
* Getting to see that many of them were exhausted and felt the infinite repeat of each week: work, go home to their wives, sleep/game/exercise/try new food places on the weekend. Each week was the same repetition

### June 2024: mission and vision
* enjoyed japan missions
* comforted by the confirmation of being called specifically to this workplace and this team
* reminder that the Holy Spirit is always working and has a plan with me involved
* vision of the entire campus of Meta worshipping the Lord
* renewed conviction and confirmation to minister to people at my workplace

### H2'2024: powder keg, prayer, and power
* connected to the randomest people
* many many prayers answered from many generations
* classic campus with powder kegs below it reading to pop off
* solely need to submit to the Holy Spirit; by His power, He will ignite people and fulfill His will
