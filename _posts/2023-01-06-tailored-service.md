oh man.

despite all the reasons that could have stopped me from going, I ended up
attending Higher Calling Conference 2022.

before going to hcc, I had an inkling that God was going to use that time to
cause breakthrough in my life.  it generally sounds nice but... I could tell
that it was going to be painful and I was very avoidant of it. I know God is
faithful to answer our prayers when they are according to His will, which made
it even more difficult for me to genuinely pray for the conference going in.

### [Day 1] Tuesday, Dec 20, 2022

at the first night's plenary, P. Harold delineated 3 different types of
suffering and what God offers for each one. *[1. You did something wrong]* so
the solution is to accept Jesus as the sacrifice for your sins. naturally,
when he went onto *[2. You did nothing wrong]*, I expected a similarly
straight-forward solution, but instead he said Jesus offers total solidarity.
I stubbornly (and pridefully) rejected that, thinking that I don't need
emotional support. I was looking for a solution on how to move forward and
past my suffering, I didn't want *emotional support*. Then P. Harold went onto
the third point, *[3. Natural wrongs]* - God offers tailored service to what you
need. The speaker told the story of how Jesus responded to Mary and Martha in
John 11 when their brother died, emphasizing that Jesus knows exactly what we
need. I realized that although emotional support is not what I want, it might be
what I need.

This past semester (fall 2022) was a time where I grew so much spiritually
serving in ministries, surrendering my future to Him, and sharing life with my
brothers and sisters in Christ. But at the plenary session, I realized that this
growth happened largely as a result of the suffering that I had gone through and
was currently going through. I hadn't allowed myself to acknowledge the
suffering because I had seemingly been spiritually thriving, but during the
personal prayers I realized that I had been instinctively hardening my heart
as a way of protecting myself from the pains of suffering. Despite recognizing
this, I couldn't bring myself to pray for more pain so instead I asked a staff
member to pray for softening of my heart instead.`

### [Day 2] Wednesday, Dec 21, 2022

After that, I went to the prayer room multiple times. I still didn't know what
God wanted me to do, but it helped correct my heart posture. *Pride is not
"thinking too highly of yourself", but pride is "thinking about yourself too
much"*. I had been thinking about what God wants me to do and how I should
resolve my issues, that I had forgotten to actually focus on God. So in the
prayer room, I just came before God in adoration, surrendering everything to
Him. Even without knowing how God wanted to guide me, I still put everything
down and came before Him, trusting that He knew what was best.

Continuing in the day, I went to the **"Worship Unto Love" seminar by David
Cho**. A big commitment this semester was being a leader in the Christian a
cappella group, where I spent a lot of time trying to pursue excellence for the
glory of God. Coming from a place where I wanted everything I do to be an act
of worship, I was curious for what he had to say. But then he started on his
testimony... he shared about many situations where he had struggled with his
mental health and how they guided him to God... and even beyond when he was
saved. I've supported many people in their mental health struggles and shared
my own story countless times so I didn't expect to be fazed by David Cho's
testimony, but the more I continued to listen to what he was saying, the more
I realized that a lot of my journey was very similar to his. I could find
parallels between our lives as he shared about the hopelessness, insomnia, and
desperation before he was saved. Throughout his story, I felt seen. It was
special to have someone well-respected enough to host a seminar share about
struggles so similar to my own. Although I oftentimes invalidate my own
suffering, he was shining light onto it and revealing it as a real, valid
struggle for Christians as well. After the seminar, I asked a question: "How do
you worship when you're depressed?" to which I received the slightly
disappointing answer along the lines of you just force yourself. heh. In this
too though, it was nice to have someone else confirm that the way that I was
pursuing Christ was acceptable. Though it was not the seminar that I expected,
I could still confidently see that it was part of what God wanted me to hear.

The next seminar that I attended was **"Made for Relationship" by Gina and Lucia
GSNs**. They had a very informative section with great info (that i took notes
on and was also useful in post-hcc convos) but it also left me with a lot of
questions regarding relational hurts. After learning about how to form and
maintain fulfilling relationships, I kept on coming back to the reasons I was
hurt in some past relationships (some common pitfalls present in them) and
questioned how I could heal and move past in them. I ended up talking to Lucia
GSN after the seminar. To be honest, I was kinda forced into it by a sister that
summoned Lucia GSN, told me to talk, n then disappeared... So I didn't really
know how to start but I shared about a relationship that I think God had
particularly brought up during the seminar (related to [shaken]({{ site.baseurl }}/shaken)).

I'm very much an external processor, and I have a hard time processing
complicated events if I'm not talking it out with other people (journaling
kinda helps but it's difficult). This semester, stepping into a new year with
a new fellowship and my closest friends graduated, I had a hard time sharing
with people about this because of creating drama or starting gossip. But as a
result, I realized that I had also spent this semester just suppressing my
thought and emotions and not processing anything throughout the 5 months. I
realized that the issue was not actually knowing how to forgive as I had
initially thought, but the reason I didn't know how to forgive was because I
hadn't actually allowed myself to feel hurt for what had happened. As I
shared with Lucia GSN, it became more clear to me that in order to get to a
place of forgiveness, I first had to feel the emotions that came with the
circumstances and process them.

so... the emotional support *was* something I needed :')

The rest of this night was spent pouring out into some other people... God
works. He orchestrated specific things to happen in this way and I was very
blessed to be able to support other children of God. (their stories are not
mine to tell ðŸ¥°)

### [Day 3] Thursday, Dec 22, 2022

A lot of this morning was also spent focused more on surrender, obedience,
and listening to God. LTC was great, I felt like there was a lot of good info
but I was very tired so it's something I'll go over at another time before
the semester starts so that I can grow in discipleship ðŸ˜…

As this day passed, I found myself growing more scared. Scared that God will
actually move in my heart and I'd feel all the pains that I've been running
from the entire semester. Scared that God won't move that day and I'd leave
hcc knowing that I had succeeded in running away from my problems but be left
with the fact that I still had issues that I needed to face someday. This
anxiety kept me on edge and I couldn't stay still, couldn't focus on just one
thing. Before evening plenary that day, I went to the prayer room again and
just... surrendered :') I want to keep running. I don't want to continue
healing. I don't want to face my problems. I want to ignore all the bad. But
ultimately, God is worth everything and He can have it all. That evening
plenary speaker actually spoke about that as well, encouraging us to give our
brokenness and sinfulness to God as a present. To offer even the worst parts
of us to Him because God does want it all.

It was during the personal prayer part that it actually happened. I had
already surrendered, I was just waiting at that point. The staff member that
was leading the personal prayer portion read out a letter of apology from a
parent's pov. I usually think of my parents very fondly and truly think they
tried their best. So it was kinda shocking when the apology letter revealed
hurts I didn't even know I had. I had grown up as the third parent to my
brother in an immigrant family with anger management issues, and honestly...
pretty much forgotten most of my childhood. But it left me with symptoms that
weren't ideal, like how home never felt safe, emotions were villainized, but
most of allâ€”I believed that a father was unavailable and irresponsible. I did
't know how to trust God as a father because I didn't know how to rely on a
father. Despite the things I knew He was supposed to be, I didn't actually
trust God to be present, to care, to want to do something about my situation.
I called God Father every time I prayed, but I didn't actually believe it, I
treated God like another dad who may or may not know what was happening but
either way didn't care enough to step in.

The next prayer topic was for other people that we wanted to run the race
with that had not received Christ yet, and the immediate first person on my
mind was my brother. My brother had been on my heart continuously, and my
heart was desperate for him to be saved. So while others prayed for friends
or other people in the room, I threw myself before God in desperation with
the hope that my interceding could help my brother come to know Christ as I do.
This time, I made another realization. Even though I'm so imperfect, this
is what sibling love is supposed to look like. This is the love that I have
for my brother, and this is the love we're called to have for our brothers
and sisters in Christ as well. And one of the reasons that the relational
problem hurt so much was because this was innately what I had hoped for and
ultimately betrayed.

After these two realizationsâ€”my mistrust in God and an introduction to why I
was hurtâ€”I began to pray again.

And then I felt emotions. lol.\
â€¢ feeling that my trust had been betrayed\
â€¢ feeling guilt that I led another away from God\
â€¢ feeling loneliness because I didn't trust God\
â€¢ feeling the pain of sexual immorality\
â€¢ feeling the pain of depression\
â€¢ feeling the pain of suffering\
â€¢ feeling the pains that I had suppressed for so long\
â€¢ feeling the comfort of knowing brothers and sisters cared for me\
â€¢ feeling the fatherly love that God promised and that I couldn't comprehend\
â€¢ feeling the sweetness of who God is and what He's done so that we could be 
with Him

Even with all this typed out, I honestly can't explain most of what happened.
I don't know if this is something I can truly process fully, but I do know
that I felt. I felt a lot. And as a result of it, worship was even more
beautiful, surrender even sweeter, and the Gospel truly life-giving news. I
was so desperate for more of God, more of His goodness, just more of Him.
Praise poured out from my heart and it was... sweet.

After this plenary session, I was mindful not to immediately enter the frenzy
of the crowd because everything was still very tender. I was scared to forget
what had been revealed, so I spent a lot of time praying, journaling, and
thinking about how I could continue to steward this. There wasn't really a
closure to this, but I believe that this is yet another beginning to a season
of surrender and processing. I think that hcc served as a time for God to
start new things more than anything else... and I thank God.
