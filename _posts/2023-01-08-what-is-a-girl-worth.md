"[My mom] was protected because my dad loved." (12, 6)

"Love sought to understand and communicate. Instead of lashing out at frustration at what I'd done, my mom had sought to reach me with love---without sacrificing the truth or leaving others unprotected." (13, 4)

"Love cares first about the harm done to the otehr person. Unlike abuse, love does not excuse or minimize wrongdoing." (14, 2)

"If they knew, they'd stop it, right? *[...]* Someone would *stop* it. *Someone* would stop it. Right?" (26, 5)

"Someone would have stopped him. Wouldn't they?" (38, 4)

"What just happened? *[...]* What just happened? *[...]* I could not reconcile the man I knew with the man who had just been touching me in places and in ways I was sure he shouldn't." (55, 4)

"though I'd failed at keeping him from my body, I could keep him from my mind." (55, 9)

"Even thinking someone was a sexual abuser was an incredibly serious accusation." (56, 1)

"the [pain] giving me something to focus on and use to orient myself" (56)

"words would make it so much more real" (60, 2)

"I chastised myself, repeating the same lies I'd heard society tell every sexual assault victim: *Stop being overdramatic. It wasn't that big of a deal. You're reading into it and making it worse than it was.* Why... Why couldn't I just get over it?" (61, 2)

"Don't trust. Ever. Period." (61, 6)

"*It was my fault*" (63, 2)

"But sometimes an even more effective barrier to the truth is a community dedicated to an abuser because of what feels like a caring and good relationship" (71, 4)

"The thought of putting what I had experienced into words filled me with shame and fear." (75, 1)

"I did everything I could to bury those thoughts. And when I couldn't, I blamed myself." (83, 6)

"*I'm partly to blame. It was my fault. Both times. My fault.*" (84, 8)

"I hadn't masked my emotions well enough to hide my discomfort. I'd left myself vulnerable. Exposed." (84, 10)

"You can't keep burying it. It will destroy you." (86, 2)

"It would mean admitting that the abuse had happened and that I wasn't fine." (86, 5)

"I wanted to be done with the fear and shame. I wanted to be done with the grief. I wanted to feel whole again." (87, 6)

"*Your fault! You didn't fight back! Who is so stupid they don't even know what's happening? You didn't protect yourself because you didn't care enough! Your fault!*" (89)

"I felt unsafe everywhere." (92, 2)

"This was my fault. I hadn't stopped the abuse, and that was my fault. I couldn't stop the damage. My fault too." (93, 3)

"The book of Psalms, in particular, helped me ride the waves of pain I couldn't seem to escape" (95, 2)

"Rarely did society recognize the incredible damage of abuse, and I'd absorbed its minimizing message every day, blaming myself for the fear, the nightmares, and the anxiety." (96, 2)

"The simplest things were now unsafe because I knew that even they could be wielded like a weapon." (97, 1)

"I poured myself into my life *[...]* But I also continued to bury the tears" (97, 3)

"fighting panic attacks every time I came across a sex-related case" (98, 2)

"The only thing of which I was certain was that everyone minimized the evil and damage from abuse" (99, 6)

"Nothing could make that wrong disappear" (103, 3)

"I began to realize *[...]* how much of myself had truly been damaged" (109, 6)

"Those attributes would make me vulnerable" (love, compassion, gentleness) (110, 2)

"I knew there were men out there who could walk through the grief and pain alongside survivors, who could help them heal instead of hurt them" (113)

"Even to myself, I used euphemisms still. Words that I rarely *thought*, I would now have to speak." (114)

"I could barely fight the war within myself. I had no ability, nor any desire, to fight it with the person I let closest to me." (115, 2)

"How do you explain to someone who has never been that vulnerable that even though I wasn't 'held down', I was still trapped?" (115, 5)

"You just... shut down, because reality is incomprehensible" (115, 7)

"It was never the hand in the dark. It was always the hand that I held. And it's my fault all over again, because it never would have happened if I hadn't trusted." (116, 3)

"the internal war *[...]* when someone's actions don't match the person they're supposed to be" (116, 7)

"the scars remained. All I could do was respond to the damage." (136, 5)

"No one else had even bothered to ask why it mattered." (146, 10)

"This was the first time I had ever described the abuse to anyone. *[...]* I'd never put it into words" (151, 4)

"But the sick, burning feeling in the pit of my stomach remained" (152, 2)

"it wasn't *happening* one thing at a time" (152, 10)

"It was the answer I never wanted but desperately needed" (153, 7)

"Justice is God's work, Rachael. And I'm going to pray with you that you see it---as completely as we can reach it here on earth." (154, 7)

"Each time, a rush of nausea and fear would follow" (155, 3)

"Grief, more than anything, was what I hated to show, because it felt so vulnerable" (163, 2)

"just go somewhere else mentally" (166, 4)

"*You are not crazy. This. Is. Not. Your. Fault.*" (166, 5)

"I did need to eat. I just felt far too exhausted and sick to care" (191, 11)

"*I wasn't crazy. I hadn't ever been crazy.*" (194, 1)

"after being questioned so intensely about my abuse, I bristled at the thought of anyone touching me" (200, 5)

"To feel less alone and isolated in the fight" (267, 11)

"The only thing reporting accomplishes is heightening the trauma to almost unbearable levels. It invites an audience to view your sexual assault. It's choosing to have no voice in the process after having it stolen from you. That's why victims don't report." (271, 3)
