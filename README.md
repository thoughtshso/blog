# blog

minimalist Jekyll website currently published through github pages.

nothing much to it, i just got sick of wordpress UI and ads so i decided to try DIYing it.

## to develop locally:

clone this repo

install necessary dependencies with `bundle install` and run `make` in a terminal

* the local version of the site should be up and running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

run `make clean` to remove generated files

## things to add later (maybe sooner):

* change blog landing page
* change font to be easier on the eyes and have more contrast (i don't like the
current font)
* [google analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) support
* look up a way to add [short description](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1733) under post title for preview
* add [encrypted posts](https://github.com/lilykonings/jekyll-password-protect)
for backwards compatibility
* fill in story (currently hidden)
